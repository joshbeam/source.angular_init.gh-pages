                    angular_init (called <code>ngi</code>) creates AngularJS templates for you from the command line <strong>so you don't have to type the same starting code over and over again</strong>. It's a tool with just one purpose, so it's small and fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most developers are probably using the command line anyways in their normal workflow, so why not also create AngularJS code from the command line?
