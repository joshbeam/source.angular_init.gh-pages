                <h2>In simple terms</h2>
                <p>
                This tool, also called by its short-name <code>ngi</code>, can make (for example) an AngularJS controller template file for you (.js), so that <em>whenever you want to make a new controller for your app, you don't have to type the same starting code over and over again</em> (by the way, this tool doesn't only create controllers. It does directives, filters... almost anything).
                </p>
                <h2>Why ngi and not something else?</h2>
                <p>
                You could create your own templates and just copy and paste (but this is cumbersome). There are also all-encompassing scaffolding tools that handle a variety of tasks, like generating templates. But that's like going to a general practice doctor, when you know you just need to see the otolaryngologist.
                </p>
                <h2>ngi has one task, which makes it lightweight and specialized.</h2> 
                <p>
                Most AngularJS developers are probably using the command line already (Gulp, Bower, NPM, Git, etc.), so why not use the command line to streamline your code-writing too?
